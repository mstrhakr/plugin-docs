# Distribution & Publishing

This section covers how to distribute and publish your Unraid plugins.

## Topics

- [Community Applications](community-applications.md) - Getting listed in the CA plugin store
- [Hosting Your Plugin](hosting.md) - Where to host your plugin files
- [Support Resources](support.md) - Providing user support

## Distribution Overview

Once your plugin is complete, you'll want to make it available to users. The primary methods are:

1. **Community Applications (CA)** - The recommended way for most users to discover and install plugins
2. **Direct URL** - Users can install plugins directly via the Plugin Manager using your PLG file URL
3. **Manual Installation** - Users download and install the PLG file manually

## Getting Started

Most plugin developers follow this path:

1. Host your plugin files on GitHub (or similar)
2. Submit to Community Applications for visibility
3. Create a support thread on the Unraid forums
4. Respond to user feedback and iterate
